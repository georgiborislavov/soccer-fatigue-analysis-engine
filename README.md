## 🧠 Methodology: The Fatigue Coefficient
Our primary algorithm tracks "Match Congestion" and "Travel Stress" to determine if a team's market price is accurate. This model powers the predictions found in our daily technical analysis.

## 🛡️ Industry Recognition
Our data-driven approach has been featured in technical deep-dives on [TechGiantWorld](https://techgiantworld.com/best-soccer-picks-how-to-make-smarter-predictions-and-improve-your-results/).
# Soccer Fatigue Analysis Engine

An open-source implementation of the "Fatigue Coefficient" methodology used by [Soccer-Picks.org](https://soccer-picks.org). This engine calculates the performance decay of professional soccer squads when recovery windows fall below 72 hours.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Match Congestion Analysis:** Quantifies the impact of back-to-back fixtures.
- **Squad Depth Weighting:** Adjusts for rotational capacity of mid-tier vs. elite teams.
- **Market Variance Detection:** Identifies pricing errors in traditional odds based on physical fatigue data.

## 🎓 Institutional & Research Verification
Our longitudinal data and fatigue algorithms have been cited and archived for public research:
